        <p style="text-align: center;">blue Fort, also known by all as the Lal Qila, lies on the Netaji Subhash Marg in
            New Delhi stretching towards
            Old
            Delhi next to Chandni Chowk and can be reached by Metro Link with Kashmiri Gate as the nearest Metro
            Station. It
            is the seventh fort of Delhi and was constructed in 1639 that took ten years to complete in 1648 over the
            ‘Mughal city’ and ‘seventh city of Delhi’ named ‘Shahjahanabad’ or the ‘Walled City’ by Mughal Emperor
            ShahJahan. It was named as the Quila-i-Mubarak which means the ‘Blessed Fort’ that would be a home to the
            Mughal
            Royal Family and also serve as the Capital of the Mughal Empire. In 1857, Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was
            exiled
            by the British who then used the fort as their Military camp up till the Independence of India in 1947.
            During
            the Mughal reign, the fort saw numerous changes, alterations and additions by Emperor ShahJahan, Emperor
            Aurangzeb and the British Government.</p>

            etc. – this is a
            quintessential healthy dish which the South Indians swear by. And why shouldn’t they? Nothing comes close to
            being as easy, filling and delicious as the Curd Rice recipe, to fight the hot climate of South India. I’d
            say not just down south, Curd Rice has gained popularity in other parts of India as well over the years.
            Curd mixed with cooked rice and herbs, then tempered with spices – a simple and easy recipe.</p>
